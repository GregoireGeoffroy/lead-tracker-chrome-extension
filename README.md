# Lead Tracker Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension allows users to save and manage URLs (leads) for easy access later. It stores the URLs in the browser's localStorage and can retrieve and display them, making it a lightweight tool for tracking your online resources. You can manually add URLs or capture the active tab's URL directly from the extension. 

## Features
- Save URLs (leads) manually or from the current browser tab.
- Store leads locally using `localStorage` to persist across sessions.
- View and access saved leads from the extension's interface.
- Delete all saved leads with a double-click.
